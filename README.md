# Implementing-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch-in-Python


Implemented Linear Regression without using packages in Python. Computed predictions with closed form solution as well as using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Wrote different functions throughout the code for Stochastic Gradient Descent, Closed form solution, calculating RMSE and calculating cost function.
